Summary
The Clone property is situated 16km northwest of Goliath Resources' Surebet discovery.  Mineralized occurrences on both properties lie in close proximity to Kyba's "Red Line", a regional horizon that is an important marker for large-scale deposits within the Golden Triangle.  [See accompanying map].
High-grade, gold-bearing shear zones were discovered in 1995 on the Clone property at the head of Sutton Glacier, triggering a staking rush in the immediate area and ultimately leading to a cash infusion of $2.6 million into joint owners Silver Grail and Teuton by Prime Resources-Homestake Canada, two companies which owned the rich Eskay Creek mine.  Drilling programs from 1995-97 defined several high-grade gold shoots within the Main Zone, situated at the southeastern end of a 3km long package of volcanic and sedimentary rocks. The property has been under option twice during the preceding years but is now again owned 50-50 by Silver Grail and Teuton Resources. 
Early Exploration
Main Zone
High-grade gold and gold-cobalt mineralization occurs on the Clone property within a series of sub-parallel shears exposed over a strike length of 500m and a vertical range of 130m. Trenching of the shears returned values ranging up to 3.59 oz/ton gold over 5.5m (18 feet). Significant cobalt values were found to accompany gold in the southeast portion of the zone.
Drilling in 1995-96 was confined to the 500m long Main Zone at the south end of the mineralized system, overlapping the original discovery area. The most promising structure outlined by the drilling was the "H-1" which yielded many holes carrying high-grade gold mineralization over significant widths. The best of these was Hole #110 which contained a 32.9 foot intercept grading 1.28 oz/ton gold. Some outstanding intersections were also reported from the parallel S-2A structure, known from trenching to host both gold and cobalt mineralization. Hole #18 into the S-2A contained a 19.7 foot intercept grading 1.53 oz/ton gold and 0.33% cobalt.
In 2010 a bulk sampling program was commenced on the Clone property in the high-grade portion of the H-1 zone. A total of 34 samples taken from the one-ton lots comprising the 2010 Clone bulk sample returned an average grade of 68.65 g/t gold.   A larger bulk sample of 102 tons was taken in 2011 which averaged 137.1 g/t gold (4.0 oz/ton gold).  
Approximately $7 million has been spent on the property to date.
Recent Exploration
From 2003 to 2004 small scale prospecting and geochemical sampling has outlined a new area of interest lying 500m southwest of the previously explored Main Zone.  This area, lying very close to the "Red Line", features many samples with copper values and is now tentatively interpreted as being the distal expression of a possible porphyry copper-gold deposit at depth.  Cross-cutting structures in this locality contain high-grade gold values to 63 g/t.   Anomalous values in molybdenum, bismuth and tungsten have been found in many rocks sampled in the area.   Felsic and porphyritic dykes of Tertiary age also occur. 
Weather permitting, an IP survey is scheduled for September of 2025.
