Summary
The Konkin Silver property has multiple targets.  A Geotech ZTEM survey carried out in 2018 identified two large ZTEM anomalies-"A-9" and "A-10"-- in the eastern portion of the property.  In the west, the same survey identified a porphyry copper-gold target called the "P-3".  The ZTEM anomalies form a northerly-trending chain along a volcanic-sediment contact.  In the Del Norte property to the north (now owned by Teuton and Decade Resources), one of these ZTEM anomalies overlies the LG Vein which has been tested by many drill holes, many of them returning high-grade gold and silver values.  The vein strikes for over 500m. 
[See 2018 Geotech VTEM Survey Map] 
In the western portion of the Konkin Silver at least five structures have been tested by trenching, one of them by a short drill program.  All of them returned good silver values over widths running from 5.7 to 29 feet.  Refer to the chart below.
In the intervening years, ice has melted back considerably exposing a network of barite veins below the Konkin Silver showing.  None of these have yet been sampled.  Ross Sherlock, Ph.D., likened the main Konkin Silver showing to a white smoker, and said it resembled in some facets high-grade silver-bearing barite zones at the former Eskay Creek mine.

Description of Geotech ZTEM anomalies:
A-9  This target is located in the south-eastern part of the block and lies within the Konkin Silver mineralized zone. It lies within the Hazelton Group volcanics and appears to be structurally controlled by a NNW striking fault. It is stretching roughly in the NNW direction over a distance of ˜ 2 km along an inferred fault zone. It has an estimated resistivity value of < 30 ohm-m at depth of 300m and coincides with a strong Aerotem conductor.   
A-10  Located in the south-eastern corner of the survey area, this target is stretching roughly in the NNW direction over a distance of ˜ 1.5 km. It lies within the Hazelton Group volcanics and occurs at the contact with a magnetic structure.  It exhibits an estimated resistivity value of <25 ohm-m at depth of 300m and coincides with a strong Aerotem conductor.

The Konkin Silver is owned jointly with Teuton Resources.
