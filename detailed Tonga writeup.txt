Summary
[Put in Goliath Map]
The Tonga property is located 32 kilometres southeast of Stewart, British Columbia, at the headwaters of the O'Neill River.  It adjoins the Fiji property of Silver Grail-Teuton to the south, Goliath Resources "GoldDigger" property (home to the promising "Surebet" gold-silver zone) to the east and Dolly Varden's Silver's  "Homestake Ridge" property to the west [see Goliath Map].  
It was first staked in 1985 because of high silver stream sediment anomalies recorded in the BC government Regional Geochemistry database. Float samples have been found in creeks running to 92 oz/ton silver and 1.33 oz/ton gold.  An airborne survey defined a prominent magnetic low lying between two silver anomalous creeks, and talus fine and soil sampling has also defined a multi-element Ag-Cu-Pb-Zn anomaly. 
A small drill program in one location disclosed zinc-silver mineralization. Although the property has not been explored for many years, the recent rise in silver prices has renewed interest in the area.  Owing to developments at Goliath Resources' Golddigger property adjoining to the west and south, one area on the Tonga property will receive renewed exploration.  This area is marked by numerous quartz veinlets carrying pyrrhotite, pyrite and minor galena and sphalerite mineralization.  Gold and silver values here were low on surface, but this may be due to vertical zonation.  At Goliath's adjoining property, pyrrhotite, pyrite and base metal veins carry precious metal values; these are generally weaker high in the system and strengthen with depth.  To test this hypothesis at Tonga, deeper drilling will be needed in the area to see if precious metal values improve at lower elevations.
