Summary
The Gold Mountain property consists of a large number of claims adjoining on the east side of the Red Mountain property and west of the Willoughby gold-silver property.  Only a small fraction of these claims have been examined.  In one locality to the south on the former Bud claims, Silver Grail personnel found two areas of interest: in the first, a 200 by 300m wide zone of pervasive quartz calcite veinlets was found to carry gold values up to 0.632oz/ton; in the second area , chalcopyrite and bornite mineralization are found associated with hornblende diorite dykes.  No follow-up work has been undertaken.    The property retains significant potential for Red Mountain type, high-grade gold and silver mineralization.

Red Mountain property
The Red Mountain gold property currently owned by Ascot Resources contains the most developed deposits in the immediate area.  These high-grade, gold-silver deposits have obtained final approval from federal and provincial authorities, with a production decision anticipated in the near future.
Discovered in 1989, the Red Mountain property was explored extensively until 1996 by Lac Minerals Ltd. and Royal Oak Mines Inc., with 466 diamond drill holes and over 2,000 metres of underground development completed, along with extensive engineering and environmental baseline work. Additional studies were completed over the past 12 years by Seabridge, North American Metals Corp. and Banks Island Gold Ltd.
Red Mountain is a 14-square-kilometre hydrothermal system within the Stikine terrain. Gold mineralization is associated with and partially hosted within an early to mid-Jurassic multiphase intrusive complex, with associated volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks and sediments. Many gold mineralized zones occur on the property, including four mineralized zones with established resource estimates. Three of the four mineralized zones have been folded and are separated by dip-slip fault zones: the Marc, AV and JW zones. These mineralized zones are moderate to steeply dipping, roughly tabular and vary in widths from one to 40 metres, averaging about 15 metres in thickness. Gold and silver tellurides, and free milling mineralization are associated with stockworks, dissemination and patches of coarse-grained pyrite. Alteration facies includes strong quartz-sericite alteration.
Throughout the property, multiple high-grade areas have been identified through surface sampling and local drilling by previous explorers. Of particular significance, since the vast majority of exploration work was completed on the property during 1996, and prior glacial retreat surrounding known mineralized areas has been very extensive, with up to a kilometre at the south end of the property. 
IDM Mining purchased  the Red Mountain property from Seabridge Gold in 2014 and thereafter steadily advanced the project.  In 2019, IDM was taken over by Ascot Resources, owner of the Premier Mine and associated Big Missouri and Dilworth properties.   Current 2019 resource at Red Mountain is:
