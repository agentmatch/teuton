These two companies have&nbsp;drilled over 60,000&nbsp;metres in 2023 at their Homestake Ridge-Dolly Varden and&nbsp;Golddigger&nbsp;properties, respectively.&nbsp;Recent drill results from Dolly Varden Silver have continued to expand their silver zones. &nbsp;During Silver Grail-Teuton’s property examination of&nbsp;the&nbsp;jointly-owned Fiji property, a string of fresh drill pads was observed on neighbouring Dolly Varden&nbsp;Silver&nbsp;claims extending northwest of their Homestake Main deposit. &nbsp;These drill pads had several rigs on them ostensibly testing the northwestern extension of what is known as the “Kitsault&nbsp;Valley&nbsp;Trend”, a trend which continues from the Dolly Varden and&nbsp;Torbrit&nbsp;Silver mines northwestward into the Homestake Main and beyond into Teuton and Silver Grail’s Fiji property (see map, URL below). &nbsp;Goliath Resources has also been successful in 2023. &nbsp;They recently reported that 42% of the 98 holes drilled&nbsp;so far&nbsp;in 2023 contained visible gold. &nbsp;Goliath is also investigating new mineralized zones which recently emerged from ice cover, two of which&nbsp;are on claims which&nbsp;bound properties owned by Silver Grail and Teuton.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A first batch of assay data from sampling has been received from 2023 prospecting on Silver Grail-Teuton’s Clone property.&nbsp;These include 25 grab samples from an area of the Clone property that has seen only light exploration to date and which&nbsp;is hypothesized as being&nbsp;distal&nbsp;to&nbsp;a porphyry&nbsp;copper zone. &nbsp;&nbsp;Results for copper show a range from 66 to 4,450 ppm with an average of 1,640 ppm (0.16% Cu); for silver, a range from 0.20 to 6.24 ppm with an average of 2.34 ppm, and; for gold, a range from 10 to 1,480 ppb gold with an average of 213 ppb gold. &nbsp;More samples have been sent in for assay.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Silver Grail&nbsp;and Teuton&nbsp;have owned the Clone property jointly since first staking in 1994-5. &nbsp;An optionee of the property eventually&nbsp;earned a 50% interest, leaving Teuton and Silver Grail owning 25% each. &nbsp;The interest earned by the optioneewas later put up for sale&nbsp;in 2019&nbsp;when the&nbsp;owner&nbsp;changed its business from mineral exploration&nbsp;to biopharma; it was&nbsp;subsequently&nbsp;acquired by Teuton for $200,000. &nbsp;Silver Grailnow will&nbsp;pay Teuton $100,000&nbsp;(plus interest)&nbsp;to acquire an additional&nbsp;25% interest, which would leave both companies reverting to their&nbsp;previous&nbsp;joint ownership (50-50).&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A claim map&nbsp;(drawn before the&nbsp;Kshwan&nbsp;was acquired)&nbsp;showsproperties held by Teuton and Silver Grail in this area of the Golden Triangle&nbsp;and&nbsp;can be viewed here: &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://teuton.com/StewartEastmap\"><strong>http://teuton.com/StewartEastmap</strong></a>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>Qualified Person</em></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dino Cremonese, P.

These two companies have announced plans for drilling a combined total of 58,000 metres in 2023 at their Homestake Ridge-Dolly Varden and&nbsp; Golddigger properties, respectively. This amount of planned drilling is comparable to programs slated for the Treaty-Sulphurets-Scottie-Premier area about 60 km to the northwest, traditionally the hot spot for exploration in the Triangle.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Teuton and Silver Grail own interests in many properties within this sub-region, foremost among them being the Clone, Tonga, Fiji, Midas and Konkin Silver (see end of release for URL of figures).&nbsp; Both TUO and SVG began acquiring ground here by staking beginning in the mid-1980s.&nbsp; Last year, Goliath Resources staked a large number of claims in the area after completing two successful years of exploration at their promising Golddigger property.&nbsp; Many of these newly staked Goliath claims adjoin properties long held by Teuton and Silver Grail.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Plans by Teuton and Silver Grail in 2023 call for prospecting and sampling, particularly in areas of glacial ablation (meltback of ice due to a prolonged warming trend) and along extensive portions not previously investigated.&nbsp; Teuton’s Clone property, owned 75% by Teuton and 25% by Silver Grail Resources, features a set of shear zones from which high gold grades have been found on surface and by drilling after discovery in 1996.&nbsp; A bulk sample from one location within this zone in 2011 returned 102 tons grading 4.0 ounces gold/ton.&nbsp; About $7 million has been spent at the Clone property to date and around 200 holes have been drilled.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One theory about the Clone mineralization is that it could be related to a porphyry copper-gold zone located somewhere at depth.&nbsp; This is suggested by the presence of chalcopyrite clasts in a megabreccia which is in contact with the main gold-rich, hematite-bearing shear on its northeast side.&nbsp; More work will be done this year to follow up this theory.&nbsp; Coincidentally, petrographic work in 2022 at the Goliath’s Golddigger property located 12 km to the southeast of the Clone, and which also features a set of northwest trending mineralized shear zones, also suggests a genetic link between the gold-silver mineralization observed found near surface with a porphyry feeder zone.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Work on Teuton’s Tonga and Fiji properties, owned 50-50 with Silver Grail Resources, will focus on a variety of mineralized occurrences previously found but never investigated in detail.&nbsp; Prominent silver stream sediment geochemistry found on the Tonga property is in an area with many airborne geophysical anomalies.&nbsp; Several copper soil geochem anomalies in the vicinity have never been followed up but will be investigated in 2023.&nbsp; Sedimentary exhalative lead-zinc-silver float previously found in a creek has yet to be traced to source.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The northern end of the Fiji property (to the north of the Tonga silver and gold mineralization), lies along the northwestern extension of the Kitsault Valley trend which hosts the major gold-silver Homestake Ridge zone owned by Dolly Varden, and further south the former producing Torbrit silver mine. The Fiji area has been only lightly explored in the past and in particular, there are many areas within it that have been covered by permanent snow or icefields.&nbsp; Much of these previously obscured areas have now opened up for prospecting due to meltback. &nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Silver-rich areas within the western portion of the Konkin Silver claim and surrounding properties will also be prospected.&nbsp; Again, it is hoped that ablation of icefields has exposed new ground for investigation. Ross Sherlock, Ph.D., formerly of SRK Consultants, had this to say about the Konkin Silver after a site visit: “<em>Eskay Creek is a precious metal rich VMS deposit and portions have similar geology to the Konkin showing, with high grade gold and silver in massive baritic zones.”</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To the north of the Konkin Silver are the Midas, Del Norte and Lord Nelson properties.&nbsp;&nbsp; The latter two properties, 100% owned by Teuton, are currently under option to Decade Resources.&nbsp; Around $8 million has been spent exploring the Del Norte with multiple structures identified, mostly gold-silver-lead-zinc or gold-copper.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Other properties which may be looked at will be the Ram, Bud and Gold Mountain claims, all jointly owned as between Teuton and Silver Grail.

Geo., described the Konkin Silver drill core as follows: “The drill holes intersected black matrix lapilli tuffs, dacites and fine-grained tuffs in contact with highly graphitic mudstones containing thin, rhythmic beds of pyrite over sections in excess of 50m. &nbsp;&nbsp;The presence of these pyrite beds indicates a possible VMS environment. Pyrite beds formed up to 15-20 % of the intersected sequences. Within the dacite fragments in the black matrix tuffs, minor sphalerite and pyrite is noted. Indications are that the drill holes may be in close proximity to volcanic vent areas. Core logging indicated that the holes tested rocks located at the same stratigraphic sequence hosting the Eskay Creek deposit.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Photographs of various portions of the drill core can be seen here: <a href=\"http://teuton.com/Konkinsilvercore\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>http://teuton.com/Konkinsilvercore</strong></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In Hole 21-03, a 64.45m section from 338.24 to 402.69m contains from 3 to 25% pyrite within a sequence of intercalated graphitic mudstones and dacites.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>D. Cremonese, P. Eng., President and CEO of Teuton and Silver Grail, commented as follows:&nbsp; “Past work on the Konkin Silver has been directed at replacement-style silver mineralization.&nbsp; The new 2021 exploration program is directed at VMS (Volcanogenic Massive Sulphide) mineralization and since we are in the same stratigraphic horizon as the Eskay Creek deposits, our target is precious metal-rich, &nbsp;Eskay Creek type mineralization.&nbsp; &nbsp;Because of all of the float boulders discovered earlier this year below the steep slopes overlooking the 2021 drill pads—most of them containing graphitic mudstones with up to 25% pyrite—we can infer that this area is the locus of a very large mineralizing event (further supported by the intersections seen in drill core and also by the strength and areal size of the ZTEM and VTEM anomalies).&nbsp; Some of the float boulders contain wisps of a green mineral thought to be scorodite and you can also see minor sphalerite in the dacites (in core), indicating that there are other minerals in the mix beside pyrite. &nbsp;We are really looking forward to the assays and getting back to the property in 2022.&nbsp; We are also looking forward to testing many of the other Geotech airborne ZTEM anomalies in the Midas and Konkin Silver properties, as results from the current drilling have successfully explained the strong geophysical responses seen in target ”A-9”.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Drill core samples are sent to MSA Labs’ Preparation Laboratory in Terrace, BC and assayed at MSA Labs’ Geochemical Laboratory in Langley, BC.

Surprisingly, there are almost no fragments of green andesitic rocks as observed in all local outcrops.<strong>&nbsp; </strong>It looks like these 4 samples represent material from a completely oxidised and disintegrated mineralized zone. The zone must be of substantial size as there is no other way to explain such a big concentration of mineralized (Fe, Mn) and altered fragments.&nbsp; Sections of the creeks where the examined samples were collected either cut through or are very close to a large cobalt bearing zone. There is a good chance that just by using an excavator to dig closely spaced pits close to these samples, we can expose the cobalt bearing zone(s).”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fragments from these stream sediment samples were sent for thin section analysis at Vancouver Petrographics.&nbsp; Other samples have been sent to UBC for Xray Diffraction in order to identify mineral constituents.&nbsp; Once these results are in hand, the Company will begin the next step of exploration at the Pacifico.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Silver Grail owns 100% of the Pacifico property, subject to a 2% NSR.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Tonga and Fiji Properties, Golden Triangle, BC</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Tonga property is located 32 kilometres southeast of Stewart, British Columbia, at the headwaters of the O’Neill River.&nbsp; It adjoins the Fiji property to the south, Goliath Resources’ “GoldDigger” property to the east and Fury Gold’s “Homestake Ridge” property to the west [see URL for map at the end of the release].&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It was first staked in 1985 because of high silver stream sediment anomalies recorded in the BC government Regional Geochemistry database.

Altogether 8 separate stream sediment sample sites on the Pacifico property have now recorded values in excess of 1,000 ppm cobalt.&nbsp;&nbsp;To put these values in context, one can refer to the more than 64,000 stream sediment/moss mat samples which have been taken over a 40 year period throughout the province of British Columbia by the BC Government Regional Geochemistry program:&nbsp;&nbsp;highest sample in that entire database was 860 ppm cobalt but that one came from a warm spring and was not from a conventional stream.&nbsp;&nbsp;The third highest sample in the database, 584 ppm cobalt, came from what was subsequently staked as Silver Grail’s 100%-owned Pacifico property.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2020 Pacifico cobalt stream sediment anomalies were also accompanied by anomalous levels of both silver and manganese.

    "content": "<strong><em>February 6, 2019--Vancouver, BC</em></strong><em>:   </em><strong>Silver Grail Resources Ltd</strong>. (“<strong>Silver Grail”) ( (“SVG”-TSX-V) </strong>is pleased to announce results from surface programs carried out over its properties in 2018.\n\nThree follow-up sampling programs were carried out over the 100% owned, Pacifico property located at the northern end of Vancouver Island.  The principal target of these efforts was a stream from which a BC Regional Geochemistry survey had returned a value of 584 ppm cobalt, the highest stream/mossmat geochemical sample for that metal in the province.   Three geochem samples were taken from the side of a road from close to the government geochem sample site, returning values of 224, 228 and 682ppm cobalt—all highly anomalous.  Subsequently, a grid was emplaced and thereafter over a hundred soil samples were taken to the east, in an area transected by the anomalous stream.  Sporadic cobalt highs of 180, 220 and 344ppm were obtained from marshy sites situated along the stream course.  Results suggest that the source of the cobalt anomalies is further upstream.  Accompanying all of the 2018 geochemical cobalt anomalies were high values in manganese, ranging from 0.5 to 5.6%.\n\nPart of the 2018 exploration program at the Pacifico involved taking soil and/or rock samples at regular intervals along a small portion of the logging road network that criss-crosses the property. This limited work identified three anomalous areas with potential to host porphyry copper type mineralization.  In one of these areas, four successive samples taken along 400m of road returned values ranging from 152 to 313ppm, averaging 202ppm.  In another location over 2km away, a series of rock grabs along a partially uncovered face contained anomalous copper values.  A single sample from a third site, taken from an altered intrusive rock containing very minor amounts of malachite (exposed at the side of the road), returned an assay of 1.8% copper.\n\nFurther follow-up prospecting and sampling is planned to assess the copper potential of the property as well as to continue the search for the source of the anomalous cobalt values found in streams and soils. Additional staking has been carried out.\n\nOn the Company’s Roman property east of Harrison Lake, jointly owned with Teuton Resources Corp., geochemical soil sampling was carried out in 2018 in an attempt to extend known cobalt-nickel anomalies beyond the edges of a soil grid emplaced several years ago.  This work was successful in extending the anomalies to the west and south.\n\nMinor sampling was also carried out on Silver Grail’s 100% owned Kobald claims.   This work attempted to follow-up a highly anomalous copper-cobalt stream sediment anomaly identified during a BC Regional Geochemistry survey.  Although the source of the government stream sample was not determined, three of the float samples taken returned anomalous values in cobalt and copper. More follow-up work is planned.\n\nSamples taken during the 2018 programs were analyzed by Activation Laboratories Ltd. in Kamloops, BC. and SGS Canada Inc.in Burnaby, BC.  Both are accredited laboratories.\n\nThe Qualified Person for the purposes of this news release is Dino Cremonese, P.Eng., President of Silver Grail Resources Ltd.; Mr. Cremonese, as president and director of the Company, is not independent of the Company.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRespectfully:\n\n<em>“Dino Cremonese, P.Eng.”</em>\n\nPresident, Silver Grail Resources Ltd.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFor more information contact Investor Relations at 778-430-5680 or <a href=\"mailto:barry@teuton.com\">barry@teuton.com</a>.

    "content": "<strong><em>April 5, 2018--Vancouver, BC</em></strong><em>:   </em><strong>Silver Grail Resources Ltd</strong>. (“<strong>Silver Grail”) ( (“SVG”-TSX-V) </strong>is pleased to announce the acquisition of five separate cobalt properties in British Columbia.  The properties were acquired from a private company controlled by the President of Silver Grail for reimbursement of costs of staking.  The private company will retain a 2% Net Smelter Royalty and any future purchase of the royalty by the Company will require regulatory approval (cf. Location Map, below, showing 5 new cobalt properties, plus pre-existing Roman cobalt property).\n\n<a href=\"https://silvergrail.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Cobalt-General-Map-V4d_001.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6606\" src=\"https://silvergrail.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Cobalt-General-Map-V4d_001-867x1024.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"591\" /></a>\n\nCobalt is currently a much sought after metal.  Demand has grown remarkably and is expected to accelerate as production of electrical batteries comes onstream to underpin the growing electrical car market.  Price for cobalt has climbed steeply from $10/lb to over $40/lb since mid-2016.\n\nThe five properties contain streams from which stream sediment/moss mat samples taken during BC Regional Geochemistry surveys all reported extremely anomalous levels of cobalt.  On one of the properties, the Pacifico, covering an area of 1,850 hectares, three distinct streams had samples with cobalt contents of 178, 214 and 584ppm.  The 584ppm anomaly is the highest recorded for cobalt in the province of more than 64,000 stream sediment/moss mat samples; the 214ppm value is the 7th highest cobalt in the province (cf., Cobalt Geochemistry map, below, for the Pacifico property, Vancouver Island).\n\n<a href=\"https://silvergrail.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Pacifico-V2_001.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6597\" src=\"https://silvergrail.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Pacifico-V2_001-791x1024.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"647\" /></a>\n\nAnother property, the Kobald, features a stream from which a sediment sample recorded 302ppm, the 4<sup>th</sup> highest cobalt in the province. It was accompanied by a very anomalous level of copper, 2,622ppm, the 6<sup>th</sup> highest copper value in the province.\n\nNotably, three of the new cobalt properties contain stream sediments that are also very anomalous in manganese, including the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> highest values in the province, suggesting a cobalt-manganese mineral may be the source.  Manganese, like cobalt, is an important battery component in the green revolution and it is also an important additive in the steel industry.  Its price has risen 40% since 2016.\n\nFollow-up work is planned as soon as weather conditions permit.  Further stream geochemical sampling will be accompanied by property wide prospecting to try and determine the source of the anomalies.  Any targets produced by this work could be subject to a drill program.\n\nThe five new properties, which are 100% owned, complement the Company’s 50% interest in the Roman property, which covers the western end of a large ultramafic body located just east of Harrison Lake on Talc Creek.  Limited soil geochemical surveys conducted in past years have outlined two distinct anomalous areas.  One of these contains a series of 200+ppm cobalt soil anomalies with peak values to 1,314   ppm.  The other contains a Co-Ni-As soil anomaly located downhill of an Induced Polarization anomaly.  More work is planned on this property consisting of expanded geochemical and IP surveys.  The Roman is a promising property with excellent early indications for hosting cobalt mineralization (cf. Roman property, Compilation Map, below).\n\n<a href=\"https://silvergrail.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Roman-Compilation-Map-V2_001.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6595\" src=\"https://silvergrail.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Roman-Compilation-Map-V2_001-791x1024.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"647\" /></a>\n\nDino Cremonese, P.Eng., President of Silver Grail commented as follows: “The high cobalt anomalies recorded in BC government Regional Geochemical Surveys suggest the existence of undiscovered cobalt-bearing structures.  These are to be followed up as soon as snow conditions permit, a classic first step in grass roots exploration.  Early in my career, in the 1980’s, I took a number of stream sediment samples from a creek in the Stewart region, all of which returned highly anomalous levels of gold and zinc.  Subsequent prospecting uphill from the samples resulted in the discovery of the Red Mountain gold deposits, which some thirty years later are being readied for production (estimated to occur in 2020).  Let us hope that we may enjoy similar success.”\n\nThe Company’s website contains more information for all of the new cobalt properties.\n\nSilver Grail also owns interests in 12 separate silver-gold properties in the Stewart region in the southern section of the Golden Triangle.  Many of these prospects have been held since the 1980’s.\n\nThe Qualified Person for the purposes of this news release is Dino Cremonese, P.Eng., President of Silver Grail Resources Ltd.; Mr. Cremonese, as president and director of the Company, is not independent of the Company.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRespectfully:\n\n<em>“Dino Cremonese, P.Eng.”</em>\n\nPresident, Silver Grail Resources Ltd.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFor more information contact Investor Relations at 778-430-5680 or <a href=\"mailto:barry@teuton.com\">barry@teuton.com</a>.

(“Teuton”) (“TUO”-TSX-V) (“TFE”-Frankfurt) (“TEUTF”—OTCBB) are pleased to announce that 2014 reconnaissance sampling has begun on its Gold Mountain and Ram properties (see accompanying map), adjoining to the south of the Red Mountain gold property of IDM Mining, about 20km east of Stewart, British Columbia in the southern half of the Golden Triangle.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #666666;\">The companies plan to carry out prospecting particularly around zones of ablation (glacial meltback). The last time the claims were prospected was in the 1990’s. Much new ground is expected to have opened up in the interim.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #666666;\">On the Gold Mountain property previous work disclosed a 650 by 1,000 foot zone of pervasive quartz calcite veinlets, carrying gold values ranging from a few ppb up to 0.632 oz/ton. On the Ram property, prospecting has led to the discovery of several mineralized occurrences. These include hydrozincite-stained limetstone/dolomite horizons, argentiferous quartz veins, shears with minor sulphides, and a pyritic and chert horizon containing sporadic galena and sphalerite/hydrozincite. The geological setting on the Ram is prospective for BA-type mineralization, of the kind exposed on the BA property of Great Bear/Mountain Boy minerals to the north (where $5 million of exploration has disclosed an extensive silver and base metal bearing exhalative horizon).</p>\n<p style=\"color: #666666;\">Prospecting is also planned for the nearby jointly-owned Konkin Silver and Fiji claims. On the Konkin Silver property several silver-bearing structures have been discovered in an exhalative horizon. One of these, the main Konkin Silver showing, returned trench results ranging from 14.8 ft. grading 2.53 oz/silver per ton to 29.5 ft. grading 34.94 oz. silver per ton. Native silver was observed in certain of the trench samples. There are some affinities with the formerly producing Torbrit silver mine located to the southwest.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #666666;\">On the Fiji, located to the northwest of the Homestake property now being explored by Agnico Eagle, previous work in 2006 led to the discovery of two mineralized zones. Five out of sixteen samples from the zones returned gold values ranging from 0.327 to 1.27 oz/ton gold. One of the zones features fracture-controlled pyrite mineralization in what appears to be a highly altered intrusive. The second zone, in an area exposed by meltback of a snowfield, features sphalerite, galena, tetrahedrite, pyrite and barite mineralization hosted in altered volcanic rocks.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #666666;\">Work in the area has been spurred by IDM Mining’s recent purchase of the nearby Red Mountain gold property from Seabridge Gold. IDM is aiming at placing Red Mountain into production possibly as early as 2016, which will materially enhance infrastructure in the region.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #666666;\">More information on the companies’ properties can be obtained from their respective websites.

(“Silver Grail) (“SVG”-TSX-V) (\"KD7\"-Frankfurt) (“SVGAF”—OTCBB) is pleased to announce that gold anomalous stream geochem anomalies have been discovered on its Silver Crown 6 property, located within the Golden Triangle region of northwestern British Columbia.\n\nThe Silver Crown 6 claim is jointly owned with Teuton Resources Corp. and is presently under option to Decade Resources (TSXV: DEC—“Decade”). It adjoins north of Decade’s Red Cliff property.\n\nRecent heavy sediment stream sampling carried out by Decade personnel investigated the area draining the postulated northern extension of gold structures on the Red Cliff into the Silver Crown 6 property. Five sample sites gave results ranging between 44.71 and 263.82 g/t gold. The high value can be considered extremely anomalous (see accompanying map for location: http://teuton.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/silvercrownanomalymap.pdf ).\n\nD. Cremonese, P.Eng., President and CEO of Silver Grail said: “These are very encouraging results which strongly suggest that a gold source lies west uphill from the streams on the Silver Crown 6 claim. This source is either an extension of the Montrose zone (located on the Red Cliff) or it could be a new, independent zone. In any event, we are quite hopeful that follow-up work will identify the area from which the gold is coming”.\n\n<strong>About Silver Grail</strong>\n\nSilver Grail owns interests in twelve properties in the prolific “Golden Triangle” area of northwestern British Columbia, many of them centred around the promising Red Mountain gold property which is presently being primed for production in 2018.

Due to low gold prices, little work was done on the Clone between 1999 and 2003. However, in 2003, Lateegra Resources Corp. optioned the property and carried out further drilling, primarily in the Main Zone, confirming and expanding the results of the 1995-7 work. After Lateegra relinquished its option, in November, 2005, on the strength of rising gold prices the Clone property was again optioned out, this time to Canasia Industries Corp.  Canasia carried out an Aeroquest helicopter-borne survey which identified several new targets on the property.  In the following and subsequent years  Canasia, which later changed its name to Makena Resources,  drilled many holes into the property (principally in the area of the Main Zone) with results which confirmed and extended previous work.  Makena ultimately earned a 50% interest in the property.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The property has been optioned out on terms which will see 5,000,000 shares of Sunvest and $200,000 cash paid to Teuton/Silver Grail, collectively, over a two year period.  Work commitments totaling $1.95 million are also to be carried out over three years.  Teuton/Silver Grail, collectively, will share a 2% NSR, one-half of which can be repurchased for $1.5 million.  Should Sunvest default on the option agreement, Teuton/Silver Grail will receive their interest in the property back and also have an option to purchase Makena’s 50% original interest for $100,000.</span>\n<ol>\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Cremonese, P.Eng., President of Teuton and Silver Grail commented as follows: “The current  tripartite ownership of the Clone Gold, with two companies owning minority interests, was not conducive to effective financing and exploration of the property.  Sunvest Ventures will now have the right to earn up to a 100% interest in the property and are thus properly motivated to fund further work.  They have an excellent Board of Directors and geological staff, and we at Teuton/Silver Grail wish them all the best in exploring the property and its many gold and gold-cobalt mineralized shear zones. The shares we will receive in Sunvest along with the Net Smelter Royalty will ensure that we will retain a significant indirect interest in the property, at no risk or expense to our shareholders.”   </span></li>\n</ol>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Qualified Person for this news release is D.

(“Silver Grail”) (“SVG”TSX-V) (\"KD7\"-Frankfurt) is pleased to announce that its Bay Silver property, situated 5km north of Stewart, BC and jointly owned with Teuton Resources Corp., has been farmed out to Decade Resources Ltd.\n\nThe Bay Silver property controls the old United Empire mine from which limited production of high-grade silver was seen in the 1920’s. Ore from the mine was shipped to the valley floor below by way of a tramline, portions of which still remain on the property.\n\nThe property contains numerous silver-rich showings some of them developed by hundreds of\n\nfeet of tunnels. In 1983 and 1984, high-grade ore was trenched from silver-lead-zinc veins, first explored in 1919. The No. 4 zone consists of a 1.2-metre-wide vein which strikes northeast and dips 20 degrees southeast. The vein contains 0.6 metres of massive galena, sphalerite and tetrahedrite in the hangingwall and 0.6 metres of quartz with disseminated sulphides in the footwall.\n\nIn previous assessment reports, a 0.61-metre chip sample across the vein assayed two grams\n\nper tonne gold, 8679.7 grams per tonne silver, 20.3 per cent lead and 20.2 per cent zinc. The No. 3 zone is reported as being located about 100 metres south of the No. 4 zone. This shear zone contains long lenses of quartz mineralized with pyrite, pyrrhotite, galena and sphalerite. These lenses are up to 1.8 metres wide associated with a stockwork of sulphide stringers and are hosted in schist which has a strike of 150 degrees.\n\nThe lower showings, 300 metres east of the No. 4 zone, consist of two quartz-sulphide veins. The southernmost vein lies along the contact between a large granodiorite dike on the east and hornfelsed argillite to the west. The vein contains lenses of pyrrhotite, sphalerite, galena and tetrahedrite in a gangue of quartz.

    "content": "Oct. 18, 2010, Vancouver, BC: Silver Grail Resources Ltd. (“SVG”, “the Company”) is pleased to announce that it has entered into an agreement to purchase the rare earth Major Hart property located 90km northeast of Dease Lake, BC.\n\nThe Major Hart property covers 5344 hectares (13,200 acres) of mineral claims covering highly anomalous rare earth element and strategic metals, as defined by stream sediment samples collected by the British Columbia Regional Geological Survey. The anomalous stream drainage trend and coincident pluton-host contact zone is over 10 km long. The broad contact zone, within and adjacent to the pluton, is considered to be prospective for the discovery of rare earth elements, related strategic metals, and quite possibly emeralds near the contact with the ultramafic rocks. The pluton is a one-of-a kind Eocene intrusive located between the Kechika Fault and the Kutcho Fault in the Omenica Terrane of British Columbia. This is in an area of intense and prolonged crustal faulting and deformation. Of the 7 stream sediment samples comprising the Major Hart anomaly cluster, 7 are &gt;99 percentile for Bismuth, Lutetium, Rubidium, Tantalum &amp; Tungsten; 6 are &gt;99 percentile for Ytterbium, and 4 are &gt;99 th th th percentile for Fluorine in water; 5 are &gt;99 percentile for Cesium &amp; Hafnium (in comparison to the B.C. provincial RSG stream sample database). The partial rare earth element results to date indicate a propensity towards the more valuable heavy rare earths.\n\nA program of heavy mineral sediment sampling and prospecting is to begin immediately. The complete suite of rare earth elements and strategic metals will be analyzed for.\n\nTerms of the agreement call for the payment of $100,000 and the issuance of 1,000,000 shares of Silver Grail to the vendors over the three year term of the option, subject to regulatory approval. Initial payment is $10,000 and 100,000 shares. The vendors are at arms-length to the Company and will retain a 2.5% NSR on minerals and a 5% GOR on gems.\n\nD.

(“Silver Grail”) (“SVG”) is pleased to announce that 5 holes have been drilled to date at the Clone gold property located southeast of Stewart, BC. A Kubota excavator has been flown to the site and preparations for the planned bulk sampling program are almost complete. Of the five holes, four have been logged. Each of these four encountered the H-1 zone which is characterized by massive hematite, specularite, occasional chalcopyrite and minor quartz veining. Visible gold has been spotted in all four holes.\n\nThe first five holes are situated southeast of the final holes of the 2009 program. They have been drilled at shallow angles, the better to intersect the high-grade portion of the H-1 system which has been interpreted as plunging into the hillside at from 5 to 10 degrees. Results from the holes are expected to guide the bulk sampling program.\n\nSamples from two of the holes have already been sent out for assay, and the following two will be sent out on Tuesday. Pioneer Laboratories of Richmond, BC will be undertaking the analyses.\n\nIn other news, assay results for the preliminary surface sampling on the High property are in, and range from 2 to 1320 ppb gold.

hole</em>\n\nThe holes were drilled between Trenches 4, 14 and 15 on the H-1 structure and were designed to guide an upcoming bulk sampling program which will concentrate on the same area.\n\nHole 28 graded a remarkable 1.305 oz/ton over a true width of 38.6 feet. Overall, 8 of the 15 holes reported intervals with high to very high grades ranging from 0.315 oz/t to 1.759 oz/t gold. The remaining 7 holes reported lesser gold values, with the exception of Hole 23 which was barren. In some of the holes an intervening dyke partially obliterated the mineralized zone.\n\nDip angles for the holes were either minus 20, 30 or 40 degrees. For the purposes of calculating the true width coefficient, the zone is estimated to be vertically dipping.\n\nMineralization is localized within highly silicified semi-massive to massive hematite-specularite and gold occurs as fine disseminations and is associated with the oxide mineralization. The major lithology is observed to be light grey to green andesitic pyroclastics intercalated with fine grained to aphanitic andesite. Clasts are subangular to angular, matrix supported, and range in size from 1-3cm. Quartzcalcite stockwork pervades the unit in moderate abundance.\n\nCanasia Industries Corporation is funding the program and can earn a 50% interest in the property from joint owners Silver Grail and Teuton by expending $1.8 million over five years.\n\nE.R.

They were successful in intersecting sheared mineralized sections displaying local auto-brecciation, intense hematite alteration, chlorite stringers, and the cobalt containing mineral, erythrite.\n\nResults are as follows:\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"659\"><strong>Hole #        From (m)             To (m)   Interval(m)                   TW          Au (g/t) Coefficient</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"659\"><strong>6               </strong>17.98               22.25                 4.27               0.940                 2.00</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"659\"><strong>7               </strong>19.51               24.38                 4.87               0.867                 3.00</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"659\"><strong>8               </strong>14.94               24.69                 9.75               0.745                 2.05</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"659\"><strong>9               </strong>14.63               22.86                 8.23               0.985                 8.07</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"659\"><strong>11               </strong>35.36               42.37                 7.01               0.500                 3.82</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nThese holes returned lesser gold values over widths varying from 4.27 to 9.75m. True width coefficients are given in the table.\n\nHoles #1 to #5 were drilled northwest of Trench #4 and did not return appreciable gold values. These holes were probably erroneously sited due to deep snow conditions.\n\nCanasia Industries Corporation is funding the program and can earn a 50% interest in the property from joint owners Silver Grail and Teuton by expending $1.8 million over five years.\n\nE.R.
