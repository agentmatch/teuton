Detailed Fiji Write-up
[Put Goliath Map here, with the text to follow...there is a short blurb in the right side of the Goliath Map that still applies]
High gold values have been found on surface in the northern part of the Fiji property within the northwest-trending Kitsault Valley Trend (as defined by Dolly Varden Silver, owner of the major property adjoining to the east).  Five out of sixteen samples returned gold values higher than 11 g/t, ranging from 11.21 to 47.1 g/t gold   The Kitsault Valley trend begins in the Dolly Varden silver-bearing deposits to the south (Torbrit, Dolly Varden, Wolf, Moose, etc.) and continues northwest into and past the Homestake Ridge gold-silver deposit.  Anomalous gold and silver soil and rock geochemistry has been found by Dolly Varden stretching northwest from the Homestake Ridge deposit to the common border between the Fiji property and the Homestake Ridge property.  The high gold values found on the Fiji are just east of this common border on Fiji ground. Continuation of this trend is down a steep cliff to the north which remains to be sampled by mountaineering geologists. 
Further to the northwest, still in the Kitsault Valley Trend, ablation of snow and ice in recent years has exposed a strong, quartz-carbonate structure (see video: Recently Exposed Vein on Fiji property).  This structure has the potential to carry silver-bearing shoots as found by recent drilling on Dolly Varden's Wolf vein.  It has not yet been drill-tested.
